# Tab Notes
Open a new tab and write anything.

## Features:

* **Easy-to-use**: Just open new tab, and write down thoughts.
* **Auto-save**: No worries about saving things when writing.
* **Theme**: Support light and dark theme.
* **Lightweight and fast**
* **Multi-notes**
* **Browser-action with shortcut**: You could use it without changing your current new tab page.
* **Customization**: Edit font, font size and more.
* **Images**: Paste images in your notes.
* **Styled text**: Make your text bold, italic or underlined.
* Open-source

### Experimental features:
* **Exporting to txt**: This works, but you could encounter issues. Please open an issue on this repository if you do.
* **Exporting all notes**: The old export page still exists, but I didn't change anything and thus it's very broken currently.
